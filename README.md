## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup / Not semantic only the all page wrapped in ```main``` tag
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Make border thinner with opacity. Border doesn't get smaller than 1px  

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
  border-top: 0.1px solid hsla(0, 0%, 59%, .3);
```

### Continued development

Placing background images (the circle one) was a bit challenging. I'm not happy with the result when resizing window. Circles acts weird. My be fixed with js.
